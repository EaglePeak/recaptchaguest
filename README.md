# Recptcha Guest
Plugin to allow the use of the [aberkie/craft-recaptcha](https://github.com/aberkie/craft-recaptcha) plugin in [Guest Entries](https://github.com/pixelandtonic/GuestEntries) submissions.

## Installation and use
Place the recaptchaguest folder in your craft plugins directory. Activate the plugin in the admin settings.
That's it! If any of your Guest Entries forms have the recaptcha field on them, they won't save if it doesn't validate.
No other types of form submissions are affected.
